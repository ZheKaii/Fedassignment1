# NewJeans Website

This is my FED assignment 1 project

For this project, I am creating a Newjeans website for users or fans to use it or to know more about them. Since Newjeans is still a new korean group as they just debuted last year, I feel that it will be a good opportunity to make a website for them. I would want more people to know about Newjeans. For the index page, I have music video for fans or potential fans to enjoy their music. I have also included Newjeans social media for them to follow if they want to. For the other pages, I will include profile page, merchandise page and music page.

## Design Process

For the design process, I want my website to be focusing on NewJeans fans, regardless if they are a new Bunnie (Bunnie is the fandom name of NewJeans) or not. In a Korean Pop group website, fans and users would want to know more about the members. It could be about the members itself or maybe their lifestyles. Through my website, fans and users will be able to do so.

If I am a user, I would want the website to have a home page with their pictures, albums, videos. Also, I would want a page about the members so I am able to know more about them. Moreover, there should be pages to promote their music and merchandise. In addition, it will be great if I am able to sign up an account in the website.
